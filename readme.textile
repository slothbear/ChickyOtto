Hire Farmer Otto and relax.

ChickyOtto is a single-purpose version of Farmer Otto. Its sole goal
is to stuff chicken coops to harvest premium eggs. Farmville has closed
this loophole. Coops no longer go to 100% via this method.

A friend mentioned that you can keep the coop full-1 and feed one ready
chicken into the coop, wait 5 minutes, then harvest. ChickyOtto could be
modified to follow that method. I welcome your pull requests.
